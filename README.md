# Fitness Store Server Side

The Fitness Store Backend is the server-side component of the Fitness Store project, responsible for handling requests, managing data, and enabling communication between the frontend and external services.

## Technologies Used

This backend server is built using the following technologies and libraries:

* Express.js: We've utilized Express.js to create a robust and   efficient web server, enabling the handling of HTTP requests and routes.

* MongoDB: MongoDB serves as our database system, offering a flexible and scalable solution for storing and retrieving data related to gym equipment and users.

* jsonwebtoken: jsonwebtoken is employed for secure user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

* Cors: To handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and ensure secure communication between the frontend and backend, we've integrated the Cors middleware.

* dotenv: The dotenv library allows us to load environment variables from a .env file, enhancing configuration management.
